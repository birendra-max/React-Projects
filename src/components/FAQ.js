                                    If you haven't received your refill within the expected period, please take the following steps:
                                    <li>Check the refill status via the pharmacyâ€™s website or mobile app, if available.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Reach out to the pharmacy directly to inquire about any delays.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Make sure your contact information is current, so the pharmacy can reach you if necessary.
                                    </li>

                                <p>
                                    There are several potential reasons for a refill being canceled, including:
                                    <li>The prescription has expired.</li>
                                    <li>Issues with insurance coverage.</li>
                                    <li>The medication is out of stock.</li>
                                    <li>Problems with the prescription details (e.g., incorrect dosage).</li>

                                    If you have been charged but your refill was canceled, please contact our customer service team to investigate. We will look into the issue and provide a resolution, which may include a refund if warranted.
